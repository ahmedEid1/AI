## Specification
Complete the implementation of preprocess and np_chunk, and complete the context-free grammar rules defined in NONTERMINALS.

- The preprocess function should accept a sentence as input and return a lowercased list of its words.
    - You may assume that sentence will be a string.
    - You should use nltk’s word_tokenize function to perform tokenization.
    - Your function should return a list of words, where each word is a lowercased string.
    - Any word that doesn’t contain at least one alphabetic character (e.g. . or 28) should be excluded from the returned list.
- The NONTERMINALS global variable should be replaced with a set of context-free grammar rules that, when combined with the rules in TERMINALS, allow the parsing of all sentences in the sentences/ directory.
    - Each rules must be on its own line. Each rule must include the -> characters to denote which symbol is being replaced, and may optionally include | symbols if there are multiple ways to rewrite a symbol.
    - You do not need to keep the existing rule S -> N V in your solution, but your first rule must begin with S -> since S (representing a sentence) is the starting symbol.
    - You may add as many nonterminal symbols as you would like.
    - Use the nonterminal symbol NP to represent a “noun phrase”, such as the subject of a sentence.
- The np_chunk function should accept a tree representing the syntax of a sentence, and return a list of all of the noun phrase chunks in that sentence.
    - For this problem, a “noun phrase chunk” is defined as a noun phrase that doesn’t contain other noun phrases within it. Put more formally, a noun phrase chunk is a subtree of the original tree whose label is NP and that does not itself contain other noun phrases as subtrees.
        - For example, if "the home" is a noun phrase chunk, then "the armchair in the home" is not a noun phrase chunk, because the latter contains the former as a subtree.
    - You may assume that the input will be a nltk.tree object whose label is S (that is to say, the input will be a tree representing a sentence).
    - Your function should return a list of nltk.tree objects, where each element has the label NP.
    - You will likely find the documentation for nltk.tree helpful for identifying how to manipulate a nltk.tree object.
You should not modify anything else in parser.py other than the functions the specification calls for you to implement, though you may write additional functions and/or import other Python standard library modules. You will need to modify the definition of NONTERMINALS, but you should not modify the definition of TERMINALS.
